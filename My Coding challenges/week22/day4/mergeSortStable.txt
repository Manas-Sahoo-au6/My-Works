Is merge sort stable, inplace and find its time complexity?

Merge sort is stable sorting method.

Merge sort's most common implementation does not sort in place.
Therefore, the memory size of the input must be allocated for the sorted output to be stored in.

The worst case time-complexity for merge sort is in the order of O(nlogn)
