# Explain merge sort with [70,50,30,10,20,40,60] in 100 words

step-1: Initially, define a list 'arr' by initializing with [70,50,30,10,20,40,60]

step-2: initially call the merge_sort function using array, low index and high index as arguments.

Step-3: as long as the low index value is less than the high index, we allow recursive calls of
        merge-sort function.

Step-4: Now measure the mid value(mid=((low+high)//2))

Step-5: Now call the merge-sort function with array, low value and mid value rcursively

Step-6: Call the merge-sort function with array, mid+1 value, and high value recursively

Step-7: After calling the merge sort function recursively, we'll get low,mid and high values

Step-8: We'll use the low,mid and high values to merge two lists by slicing method 
        i.e. arr[low:high+1] = merge(arr[low:mid+1],arr[mid+1][high+1])
      
Step-9: The output array of the above list is the return value to rcursive calls

Step-10: This process will continue until the entire llist gets sorted out.
