### “IMAGE OPTIMIZATION INCLUDES THINGS LIKE CORRECT SIZING AND, MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE SPEED OF DELIVERY.”

>A CDN is a server that sits in the middle of your front-end and backend. It is able to speed up your website by caching, so requests don’t have to reach your own server in order to get a proper response. This enables the CDN to serve responses even if your website is down,

## Is an image CDN any different?
>Since CDNs work by caching responses that are supposed to be sent back to the client, they predictably don’t work very well with dynamic data. Where they truly shine is serving static assets like CSS files, scripts, and images.

>The principle behind an image CDN is essentially the same as for a normal CDN server. However, the main difference lies in the fact that image CDNs have features that optimize serving images above all else, in the same way that video CDN is optimized to serve video better

>These normally also contain additional features like transformations, compression and resizing. In the end, they exist simply to optimize image delivery.

### Benefits of using a CDN
***
>Scaling your site gets easier
As your site gets larger, the main problem you’re probably going to have to deal with is a larger server load. At this point, sudden jumps in visitors is going to lead to outages. This is especially considering how expensive memory-wise it is to serve images.

Since the CDN is going to have your images cached, the requests are not going to hit your server. All the power you could have spent on your own server is done by the CDN instead. As your site grows larger, you can be sure of constant uptime.

### A CDN will greatly speed up your site
>Aside from caching, CDNs also speed up image delivery by using servers that are closest to the user. This cuts down on the distance that files have to travel, greatly increasing the speed of delivery.
